## **Hey，this is me**
I don't really say this that often
But there's something that the papers forgot  
Every time I read them, I know I feed them  
But I know, they're painting but they can't leave a mark  

You don't know me    
Don't you think that I get lonely?  
It gets dark inside my head   

If you're lonely  
Don't you think you're on your own  

Does anybody know what that's like?
