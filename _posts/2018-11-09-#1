## **Hey，this is me**
> I don't really say this that often
　　
　　But there's something that the papers forgot
　　
　　Every time I read them, I know I feed them
　　
　　But I know, they're painting but they can't leave a mark

   
   You don't know me
　　
　　Don't you think that I get lonely?
　　
　　It gets dark inside my head
　　
　　
   If you're lonely
　　
　　Don't you think you're on your own
　　
   
   Does anybody know what that's like?
